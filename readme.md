#2 Player Game Server

A server implemented with sockets and threads that can host multiple instances of 2 player games such as Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect 4.  

Run game_manager.rb to load games and start server.  Run game_client.rb to connect.

Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect 4 programs include AI's with 3 different difficulty levels, using minimax.

The server will run any 2 player game that implements the methods in fake_game.rb.

The Tic Tax server was built to allow different RCers to play our Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect 4 AI's against each other.
